// Container/Presentational Pattern - Enforce separation of concerns by separating the view from the application logic

/**
 * Ideally, we want to enforce separation of concerns by separating this process into two parts:

@Presentational_Components : Components that care about how data is shown to the user. In this example, that's the rendering the list of dog images.
@Container_Components : Components that care about what data is shown to the user. In this example, that's fetching the dog images.
